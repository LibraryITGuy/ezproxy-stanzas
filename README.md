# ezproxy-stanzas
A repo for fresh-from-the-vendor EZProxy stanzas or modifications of existing stanzas not yet updated on the OCLC EZProxy Support site.

### details
- If you need a stanza, always start at OCLC's [Database Stanzas page](https://help.oclc.org/Library_Management/EZproxy/Database_stanzas).
- If you don't find a stanza there, contact the resource provider and encourage them to submit the stanza to OCLC at [ezp4publishers@oclc.org](mailto:ezp4publishers@oclc.org).
- If you haven't already done so, subscribe to the [EZPROXY-L listserv](http://oc.lc/ezplist). It's a very active list and the best source for community-contributed solutions to issues with EZProxy stanzas.

### disclaimers

- The stanzas provided here are provided "as is" and I don't warrant their reliability for your particular instance of EZProxy.
- Accordingly, I am not responsible for any loss of access to a database/e-journal site should you choose to implement a stanza you find here.
- These stanzas are intended for use on local installations of EZProxy. If you are using OCLC-hosted EZProxy, please review the [Hosted EZproxy frequently asked questions](https://help.oclc.org/Library_Management/EZproxy/Troubleshooting/Hosted_EZproxy_frequently_asked_questions)
- **I cannot provide support toward the successful implementation of the stanzas in this repo on your site.** If you need assistance with a stanza, send a message to the [EZPROXY-L listserv](http://oc.lc/ezplist) search its archives, or submit a ticket to [OCLC Support](https://www.oclc.org/en/contacts/support.html).

### sources

- These stanzas are based on revisions received directly by me from the database or e-resource provider. The EZProxy Admins at my institutions may have also contributed to the stanzas.
